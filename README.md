# restaurant-website

Hola! This is my website concept for an italian restaurant (for a restaurant that doesn't exist). A set of Jquery functions was used to implement animation (text offerings and smooth transitions). The site is responsive and adaptive (I hope so, because it was tested from all angles :D ) There are "anchor" links on the menu nav.

If you're interested, link to layout in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/rfDZMsm3MOzo4gqySkGQFU/restaurant?node-id=0%3A1

Thank you :)
